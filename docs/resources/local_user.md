## Schema

### Required

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for the local user account. This field is write-only and will not be returned in the state.
- `role_name` (String) The name of the role assigned to the user. This determines the user's permissions.
- `user_id` (String) The unique identifier for the user. This is typically the same as the username but can be distinct.
- `username` (String) The username used for authentication.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) Additional attributes (key/value pairs) may be stored with the local user account.
- `change_pwd_next_login` (Boolean) Flag indicating if the password change is required in next login.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the user account is enabled. Defaults to 'true' if not specified.
- `password_hash` (String, Sensitive) The password hash of the local user.
- `password_ntlm_hash` (String, Sensitive) The NTLM password hash of the local user.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The numeric ID of the local user. This is used as the Terraform ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Local User can be imported by ID
terraform import clearpass_local_user.john_doe 456
```
