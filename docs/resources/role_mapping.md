# clearpass_role_mapping (Resource)

Manages a Role Mapping Policy. Role mappings are used to assign roles to users or devices based on attributes such as authentication method, device type, or location.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "clearpass_role_mapping" "device_based" {
  name              = "Device-Based Role Assignment"
  description       = "Assign roles based on device type"
  default_role_name = "Guest"
  rule_combine_algo = "first-applicable"

  rules = [
    {
      match_type = "OR"
      role_name  = "[Employee]"
      condition = [
        {
          type  = "Connection"
          name  = "SSID"
          oper  = "EQUALS"
          value = "Corporate-WiFi"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `default_role_name` (String) The default role to assign if no rules match (e.g., '[Guest]').
- `name` (String) The name of the role mapping policy.
- `rule_combine_algo` (String) The algorithm used to evaluate rules. 'first-applicable' stops at the first match, while 'evaluate-all' checks all rules.
- `rules` (Attributes List) A list of rules that define how roles are assigned. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the role mapping policy.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) Numeric ID of the role mapping.

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `condition` (Attributes List) A list of conditions that must be met for this rule to apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--condition))
- `match_type` (String) Specifies whether to match ANY ('OR') or ALL ('AND') of the conditions.
- `role_name` (String) The role to assign if the conditions match.

<a id="nestedatt--rules--condition"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.condition`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the attribute to check (e.g., 'Status', 'SSID').
- `oper` (String) The operator used for comparison (e.g., 'EQUALS', 'NOT_EQUALS', 'CONTAINS').
- `type` (String) The type of attribute to check (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Connection', 'Radius:IETF').
- `value` (String) The value to compare against.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Role Mapping can be imported by ID
terraform import clearpass_role_mapping.device_based 789
```
